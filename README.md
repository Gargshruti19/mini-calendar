const date = document.getElementById("date");
const day = document.getElementById("day");
const month = document.getElementById("month");
const year = document.getElementById("year");

const today = new Date();
// ...

The styling is defined in the `style.css` file, with a combination of CSS flexbox and basic styling properties to create a visually appealing calendar.
